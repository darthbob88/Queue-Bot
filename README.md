Queue-Bot
=========

A machine for ensuring prompt service.

The primary innovations are twofold; first, it sorts according to the urgency of the customer as well as the size of the task, and second, it forces users to put their money where their mouth is. It sorts jobs so that, f'rinstance, the guy whose time is worth $20/hr or only wants to buy a box of tissues gets served before the dude whose time is worth $5/hr or wants to buy pseudoephedrine, guns, and booze. Having sorted the jobs to minimize the cost of everybody's time spent waiting, it levies a cost or pays a stipend, depending on how long everybody waits relative to a Break-Even Waiting Time. The guy whose time costs $20 and gets served first pays $10 for the privilege, while the dude whose time's worth $5 gets $10 for his patience, that kind of thing.

Current Priorities
Need to allow for persons arriving at different times.
Need to add/test flags for priority tasks or C-level/VIP customers. May also need user class.
Need to add a GUI, probably some web interface.
Need to add some testing mocks.
